## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

In `src/components/` you can place Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/icons/` directory contains svg icons.

The `src/scripts/` directory contains the scripts.

The `src/styles/` directory contains the styles.

The `data/` directory is used to store data, such as json files

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
